        <h2 class="border-top">About Aimee</h2>
        <p> As an Air Force brat, I've spent a lot of my life traveling the world. While I love to visit new places, I've also discovered that I'm really 
     enjoying putting together my own personal websites for my business.</p>
        
        <p> My journey to becoming a software developer started at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, and I couldn't be more excited with my progress!</a>
